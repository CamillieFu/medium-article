    <h2>Sometimes You Just Sink</h2>
    <p>There isn't always a silver lining. Sometimes there is nothing but rock bottom. Nevertheless, there
      are still reasons to persist, even in such hostile quarters.
    </p>
    <h2>Sometimes You Float a Bit</h2>
    <p>Oftentimes, after jumping persistenly for long enough, your feet may lift up off the ground.
      The force of the current, the force of gravity, the pull of the earth may force you back down but,
      you did it! You lifted off. If only for a brief moment. You proved to yourself.
      Things change. Things <em>can</em> change.
    </p>
    <h2>Sometime You Soar</h2>
    <p>The elusive glide which seems to ever evade our grasp can and does sometimes flitter down
      within our reach. Sometimes we soar. Fucking soar! Autonomously and powerfully
      pushing through the sky up and away from the ocean. Did it always look so beautiful?
      So blue and dark. It was always this terrifying and deep. It seems to beckon menacingly calling back down to
      that rocky bottom.
